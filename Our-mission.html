                                No one has any doubt that the clothing industry has gone into a tailspin in recent decades. the clothes have become disposable, are often made very far from home and we always buy more, to put 60% in the trash in the first year. But rather than just seeing that this world is going wrong, we prefer to focus on what we can do best. And what we can do is set in motion with a lot of new brands the next fashion revolution. In our opinion, this is what this new fashion should look like.

                        <p>About 200 billion garments were produced in 2018, largely to satisfy the functioning of the industry, which in its great mass is overproduced to sell on sale, even piling up unsold products at the end of the chain. The fashion of tomorrow must produce what is useful. And in our opinion, in this, pre-order is a model for the future.</p>

                        <p>Asphalt is first and foremost a team of 15 people. We take pictures of ourselves in hangars because it's cooler than in our offices in front of computers. Well, there are a few missing on the photo, but you get the idea.We thought there was something wrong. It was there, in 2016, that we decided to create Asphalt.</p>
                        <p> We are not very old, not very young either and we are quite nice (except the guy on the left there). We were in Paris but since September 2019, we have settled in Bordeaux. We come from far away. Before the creation of Asphalte in 2016, </p>
                        <p>we had created a classic sweater brand , Six & Sept, in 2012. This story was running. Walking is the situation where we tell everyone that it works but that in reality it does not work. We made 2 collections a year , we released lots of sweaters, when we didn't need that much. And above all we could barely afford our own sweaters , because with the classic system of resellers, stocks, sales and all the bazaar, they were worth between 150 and 300 balls. We didn't find too much sense in there .</p>
